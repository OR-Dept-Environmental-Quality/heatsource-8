## ABOUT

Heat Source is a computer model used by the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality to simulate stream thermodynamics and hydraulic 
routing. It was originally developed by Matt Boyd in 1996 as a [Masters 
Thesis][2] at Oregon State University in the Departments of Bioresource 
Engineering and Civil Engineering. Since then, it has grown and changed 
significantly. Oregon DEQ currently maintains the Heat Source methodology
and computer programming. Appropriate model use and application are 
the sole responsibility of the user.
